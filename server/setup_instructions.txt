Follow these steps (assuming u have python 3+ 64-bit installed and are on Windows):

Open terminal. (I've been using Visual Code cmd)
Make sure you are in the CanvasInsight directory!

create and activate virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

install stuff:
    pip install flask
    pip install -r requirements.txt
